## Using Data Science Techniques to Identify and Classify Phishing URLs
Extracting features and preparing datasets for data science tasks with regards to identifying phishing URLs from 'safe' URLs

### Usage
1. Clone this repository to your machine
2. Run `npm install` in the directory of the cloned repository
3. Run `node extract filename.csv` where `filename.csv` is a two-column CSV file featuring URLs and a label of 0 (meaning the URL is 'benign') or a label of 1 (meaning the URL is phishing)

__Example input CSV file structure__

| url           | label  |
| ------------- |:------:|
| timtheguy.com | 0      |
| goo.gl/abc123 | 1      |
| ...           | ...    |
